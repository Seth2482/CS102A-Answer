# Assignment 3

## Description

In this Assignment, you need to implement four classes: `Student`, `Course`, `Grade`, and `GradeSystem`.

- The class `Student` represents a student and contains attributes such as student name and student ID.
- The class `Course` represents a course and contains attributes such as course name and course ID.
- The class `Grade` represents a grade, and a grade belongs to a student who chooses a course, so the grade object needs to include the courses and student objects.
- The class `GradeSystem` represents a grade system. There are student list, course list, and grade list in the grade system. Through these lists, users can do various operations such as querying student information, querying course information, and querying grade information.

## Problems

- Problem 0: Greeting (for demo purpose) [Easy, 0 marks]
- Problem 1: Design a class named Student [Easy, 15 marks]
- Problem 2: Design a class named Course [Easy, 15 marks]
- Problem 3: Design a class named Grade [Easy, 20 marks]

## Notes for this assignment

1. You should submit all source code directly into your OJ system. Do not compress them into one archive.

2. No Chinese characters are allowed to appear in your code.

3. No package statement.

4. The output must strictly follow the description and the sample in this document. Do not print anything in all methods.

5. You may need to use `String.format()`.

6. Do not call `System.exit(code)` in your code.




## Problem 1: Student

Design a class named `Student` in `Student.java`

In this problem you need to submit: `Student.java`

`Student` describes each student. In class `Student` you need to define:

### Fields:

- ```java
  private int sid
  // Student ID. Each student’s student ID is unique and is automatically generated by class Student. Starting from 1, each new student’s ID will increase by 1.
  ```
  
- ```java
  private String name
  // Student name
  ```

- ```java
  private static int studentCnt
  // Initialized to 1, increased by 1 everytime a Student object is created
  ```

### Constructor:

- ```java
  public Student(String name)
  // Constructor, automatically generate student ID and generate student object according to the name provided by the user
  ```

### Methods：

- ```java
  public int getSid()
  ```

- ```java
  public String getName()
  ```

- ```java
  public void setName(String name)
  // Modify student name.
  ```

- ```java
  public static int getStudentCnt()
  // Get the value of StudentCnt
  ```

- ```java
  public String toString()
  // When printing an object of this class, follow the format: "Student: %s, sid: %d" (without quotes)
  ```

### Note:

- Do not define a `public void setSid(int sid)` method, as Student ID should be immutable.
- You can add other methods or attributes that you think are necessary.



## Problem 2: Course

Design a class named `Course` in `Course.java`

In this problem you need to submit: `Course.java`

`Course` describes each course. In class `Course` you need to define:

### Fields:

- ```java
  private int cid
  // Course ID. Each course’s course ID is unique and is automatically generated by class Course. Starting from 1, each new course’s ID will increase by 1.
  ```

- ```java
  private String name
  // Course name.
  ```

- ```java
  private static int courseCnt
  // Initialized to 1, increased by 1 everytime a Course object is created
  ```

### Constructor:

- ```java
  public Course(String name)
  // Constructor, automatically generate course ID and generate Course object according to the name provided by the user
  ```

### Methods：

- ```java
  public int getCid()
  ```

- ```java
  public String getName()
  ```

- ```java
  public void setName(String name)
  // Modify course name.
  ```

- ```java
  public static int getCourseCnt()
  // Get the value of courseCnt
  ```

- ```java
  public String toString()
  // When printing an object of this class, follow the format: "Course: %s, cid: %d" (without quotes)
  ```


### Note:

- Do not define a `public void setCid(int cid)` method, as Course ID should be immutable.
- You can add other methods or attributes that you think are necessary.



## Problem 3: Grade

Design a class named `Grade` in `Grade.java`

In this problem you need to submit: `Student.java`, `Course.java`, `Grade.java`

`Grade` describe each Grade. In class `Grade` you need to define:

### Fields:

- ```java
  private Course course
  // Course object corresponding to this grade.
  ```

- ```java
  private Student student
  // Student object corresponding to this grade.
  ```

- ```java
  private float grade
  // The grade (>=0).
  ```

- ```java
  private float gpa
  // The GPA calculated by grade.
  ```

### Constructor:

- ```java
  public Grade(Course course, Student student, float grade)
  // Constructor, initialize student, course, grade and GPA.
  ```

### Methods：

- ```java
  public static float calGpa(float grade)
  // A static method to calculate GPA by grade.
  ```

- ```java
  public Course getCourse()
  ```

- ```java
  public float getGrade()
  ```

- ```java
  public Student getStudent()
  ```

- ```java
  public float getGpa()
  ```

- ```java
  public void setGrade(float grade)
  // After set the grade, update the GPA at the meantime.
  ```

- ```java
  public String toString()
  // When print an object of this class, follow the format: "sid: %d, cid: %d, grade: %.1f, gpa: %.2f"
  ```

### Notes:

- Do not define these setters:
    - ```java
      public void setCourse(Course course)
      ```
    - ```java
      public void setGpa(float gpa)
      ```
    - ```java
      public void setStudent(Student student)
      ```
- You can add other methods or attributes that you think are necessary.
- GPA conversion table：

  | GRADE  | GPA  |
  | :----- | ---- |
  | 0~59   | 0    |
  | 60~62  | 1.15 |
  | 63~66  | 1.63 |
  | 67~69  | 2.08 |
  | 70~72  | 2.42 |
  | 73~76  | 2.78 |
  | 77~79  | 3.09 |
  | 80~82  | 3.32 |
  | 83~86  | 3.55 |
  | 87~89  | 3.73 |
  | 90~92  | 3.85 |
  | 93~96  | 3.94 |
  | 97~100 | 4.00 |




## Problem 4: GradeSystem

Design a class named `GradeSystem` in `GradeSystem.java`

In this problem you need to submit: `Student.java`, `Course.java`, `Grade.java`, `GradeSystem.java`

`GradeSystem` describes each Grade System. In class `GradeSystem` you need to define:

### Fields:

- ```java
  private ArrayList<Student> studentList
  // The list of students
  ```

- ```java
  private ArrayList<Course> courseList
  // The list of courses
  ```

- ```java
  private ArrayList<Grade> gradeList
  // The list of grades
  ```

### Constructor:

- ```java
  public GradeSystem()
  // Constructor, innitialize studentList, courseList, gradeList. For a list with no elements in it, its size should be 0 and its reference should not be null.
  ```

### Methods：

- ```java
  public ArrayList<Course> getCourseList()
  ```

- ```java
  public ArrayList<Grade> getGradeList()
  ```

- ```java
  public ArrayList<Student> getStudentList()
  ```

- ```java
  public boolean checkStudent(int sid)
  // If a student is not in the student list, return false.
  // Otherwise return true.
  ```

- ```java
  public boolean checkCourse(int cid)
  // If a course is not in the course list, return false.
  // Otherwise return true.
  ```

- ```java
  public boolean addStudent(Student student)
  // If a student is in the student list (i.e. his/her sid is in the student list), return false.
  // Otherwise add the student into the student list and return true.
  ```

- ```java
  public boolean addCourse(Course course) 
  // If a course is in the course list (i.e. its cid is in the course list), return false.
  // Otherwise add the course into the course list, return true.
  ```

- ```java
  public boolean addGrade(Grade grade) 
  // If a grade satisfies:
  //    - is in the grade list (i.e. a grade with the corresponding student's sid && the corresponding course's cid already exists in the grade list)
  //    - its grade in the grade list is less than 60
  //    - the new grade to be add is not less than 60
  // Update the grade in the grade list by the new grade and return true.
  // Else if the grade is not int the grade list && its corresponding student's sid already exists in studentList && its corresponding course's cid already exists in courseList, add the grade into the grade list, return true.
  // Else return false.
  ```

- ```java
  public float gpa(int sid)
  // Return the GPA of student with sid. The GPA is the average GPA of all the courses the student enrolled in. 
  // If the student has not taken any courses, return 0.
  ```

- ```java
  public float average(int cid)
  // Return the average score of course with cid.
  // If the course has no students, return 0.
  ```

- ```java
  public ArrayList<Grade> listStuGrade(int sid)
  // Return an ArrayList<Grade> of the student with sid, the order of the grades is in accordance with the course order in the CourseList. Skip courses the student didn't take.
  ```

- ```java
  public ArrayList<Grade> listCouGrade(int cid)
  // Return an ArrayList<Grade> of the course with cid, the order of the grades is in accordance with the student order in the StudentList. Skip students who didn't take the course.
  ```

### Notes:

- You can add other methods or attributes that you think are necessary.
- Do not sort the lists.
